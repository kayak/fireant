    description="Data analysis tool for Python and Jupyter Notebooks",
    long_description="Fireant is a tool which aims to simplify the process of accessing analytical data and building "
    "dashboards and reports.  It eliminates the need for handwritten queries or code to process "
    "data. "
    "The main feature, the dataset, is a schema that is used to configure metrics, the data being "
    "visualized, and dimensions, the spatiality over which metrics can be extended and grouped. "
    "Included in the Slicer is a Slicer Manager API which exposes methods to render tables and "
    "charts "
    "in a variety of different formats.\n\n"
    "Fireant is a great compliment to Jupyter notebooks using matplotlib and pandas. It can be used "
    "in "
    "web projects with Highcharts and React-Table. It can even just provide a layer of "
    "abstraction "
    "for accessing analytical data akin to ORM libraries in software projects.",
